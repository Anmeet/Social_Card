# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Run the above command to install all the packages

### `npm run dev`

Run the above command so that the Json server serves the api at port 6000. I have created a fake rest api that serves the json file. It runs the json-server and react app concurrently.

### Note

As this project needs to be completed in 6hours so I have not done testing. If there was more time duration, then I would like to work more on CSS and testing.

Thank you.
